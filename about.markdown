# About

This site is a compilation of projects from college and posts on interesting things I have learned while working.
I started writing code late in college, and have since worked at a few tech companies writing software for a DNA testing lab,
a risk management company and I am currently at Mavenlink working on their web app. In addition to writing code I also enjoy running, skiing, 
and fly fishing.
