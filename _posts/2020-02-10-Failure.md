I see people all the time saying they want to fail as fast as possible and how great failure is. Embrace failure. 
FAIL FAIL FAIL. I really hate it. Failure sucks. Our whole lives we are taught to succeed and for some reason software 
engineers are obsessed with failure. I have a degree in biology and think more in terms of experiments. It’s ok to have
your hypothesis refuted, that’s not failure. You learned something new when you did an experiment. 
 
The software we write is valuable because it has never been done. We write code that is new and exciting just like an 
experiment is. If we have a lot of experience with a particular area our hypothesizes are back with more data. We can
make more informed experiments and go in the correct direction right away. When we are experimenting with something new
it is more likely that our end results will not match our expectations. To me that is learning something new and it is 
not failure. Failure is the lack of success. Learning something new about how a line of code or a system works in 
success. Its a simple mind shift but I think it makes a big difference in our day to day lives. We don’t want to fail, 
so stop saying we should try to fail fast. Learn fast and make informed decisions. Build software you understand and 
create experiments that help you understand new ideas. Failure is not a goal.
