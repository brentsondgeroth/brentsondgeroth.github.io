I have started working more and more in C# creating MVC web applications. I have learned a ton about software in this time and wanted to share some of the tactics I have learned to deal with issues that took more some searching.

Null references have been called a billion dollar mistake. I learned a pretty slick way to deal with them that is easy to use and consistent. A guard class can be used to ensure the object you are passing into a method does not break functionality.

```csharp
public static class Guard
{

  public static void NotNull<T>(T obj, 
      string message = "Paramter cannot be null")
  {
      if (!object.ReferenceEquals(null, data)) return;

      throw new ArgumentNullException(null, message);
  }
  public static void NotNullOrEmpty(string checkString, 
      string message = "String parameter can not be null or empty")
  {
      if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(checkString))
      {
          throw new ArgumentException(message);
      }
      return;
  }
}
```

This class is can be used to guard against any object that you want to use in a method. This is really great to be able to throw and error easily by just typing...

```csharp
public class Guard
{

  public ActionResult SaveNewOrder(NewOrder order)
  {
      Guard.Notnull(order);

      var createOrder = new CreateOrder();
      createOrder.save(order);
      return View();
  }
}
```
